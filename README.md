Hit the tile

This is a game that I made for my Grade 12 Culminating Activity Project. 

We we're instructed to use Java and the Ready to Program IDE by Holtsoft to create
a Java applet game using  the mouse, keyboard, sound and graphics Java applets. 

Unfortunately, this game only works on the Ready to Program IDE that I built it on. You
can download it from http://compsci.ca/holtsoft/ to play the game. 

The instructions to play the game are included in the .java file, although I would recommend
you click full screen to play the game in its entirety. The objective of the game is to hit
(click the right keys) as many of the right tiles as fast as possible, similar to the game
"Piano Tiles". 

Feel free to add your own customizations and have fun playing!
